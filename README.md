## Overview
This is a demonstration Back-End for the Redeeming Soles "No kids left on the sideline" project. 
 This backend application utilizes a Mongo data base to track incoming shoe requests from 
 coaches and youth sports leagues for children who need sports shoes but the children's families 
 do not have the ability to obtain the shoes.  In order to best support the tracking of 
 shoes, we implemented an additional schema to account for the inventory of donated shoes to 
 match the request from coaches and sports leagues.
